## Quick start tutorial

Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

After you install Terraform and Docker on your local machine, start Docker Desktop.
```shell
open -a Docker
```

Create a directory named `learn-terraform-docker-container`.
```shell
mkdir learn-terraform-docker-container
```

Navigate into the working directory.
```shell
cd learn-terraform-docker-container
```

Create a file named `main.tf` in the working directory.
```shell
touch main.tf
```
â€» detail see [main.tf](./learn-terraform-docker-container/main.tf)

Initialize the project, which downloads a plugin called a provider that lets Terraform interact with Docker.
```shell
$ terraform init
```

Provision the NGINX server container with apply. When Terraform asks you to confirm type yes and press ENTER
```shell
$ terraform apply
```

Verify the existence of the NGINX container by visiting localhost:8000 in your web browser or running docker ps to see the container.
```shell
docker ps
```

Destroy the NGINX container with terraform destroy. When Terraform asks you to confirm type yes and press ENTER
```shell
$ terraform destroy
```
